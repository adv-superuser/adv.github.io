Adventure Team discord server will use an account strictly for Server Owner/Superuser privileges only. This allows everyone with access to Superuser account the ability to make any change to the server. I will still have email credentials that control the account but it's discord credentials will be freely accessible.
```
When you login make sure you logout when your done making changes.
It is strictly for 'Owner' privileges for more than one person but I require you to logout when you're done. 
Make sure account is set to Online when you use it, let's others know when it is being used at the moment.
I might make a log channel for when you use it mostly to prevent two or more people logging in and possibly causing a password reset from discords security measures.
